# SravanPolu(beginning of my site)

This mainly focuses on React. I created my own website and placed links to all my projects on it.
##  Utilized Programming  Languages and Libraries:
 1. React
 2. JavaScript
 3. CSS
 
## Project Working Time Experience
  - In this project, I mainly focused on React.
  - I mainly focused on how to work with real-time web pages, which is why I created my own website.
  - Even without professional experience, listing My projects prominently can demonstrate My practical skills and
understanding of the technologies I've worked with.
